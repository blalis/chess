Chess program written in pure JavaScript ( JS, HTML, CSS ).
Currently only level 0 is programmed - totally random moves made by computer
( software random generator ). There are still few minor bugs to eliminate.
Future changes and plans:
1) adding higher difficulty levels
2) adding more options
3) adding more visualisations
