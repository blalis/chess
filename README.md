A chess program written in pure JavaScript ( JS, HTML, CSS ).
Currently only level 0 is programmed - totally random moves made by computer
(software random generator). There are still few minor bugs to eliminate.
It doesn't work well (the chessboard rendering) on Firefox now.
<br>
Future changes and plans:
1) adding higher difficulty levels
2) adding more options
3) adding more visualisations
<br>

HOW TO PLAY?
<br>
To play the game you need to download the game directory and open chess.html in your browser
(JS support in browser is required!!!). Firefox/Chrome/Chromium/Opera and most of other
existing browsers should be OK.
